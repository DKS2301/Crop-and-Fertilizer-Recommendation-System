# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System  

## Overview  
This system provides recommendations for optimal crops and fertilizers based on soil and environmental parameters. It utilizes machine learning models to analyze soil composition, weather conditions, and other factors to enhance agricultural productivity.  

## Features  
- Predicts the best crop based on soil nutrients and weather conditions.  
- Recommends suitable fertilizers to optimize yield.  
- Uses machine learning for data-driven insights.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python, Flask (Backend)  
- Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy (ML Model)  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)  
- SQLite/PostgreSQL (Database)
